# Mips
Sample programs to demonstrate mips assembly language functionality. Used primarilly to better understand how registers, instructions and etc all work. 

Add 3 : allows user to enter 3 integers to be added together and displays resulting sum. 

Adding function: demonstrates how function calls in mips work. allows users to enter 2 initial numbers, then they can either hit 0 to print the sum, or continue to add more numbers to the sum until they press 0. the sum will be printed after each additional number is added

branching: just demonstrates branching in the form of an if/else 

stack: demonstrates perserving data on the stack. fully commented to explain what is happening in memory/registers as the prgram progresses.
